## About

 This fine-dining restaurant is called **Charming Thyme Trattoria** and is very popular. Due to popular demand, guests are required to make a reservation to enjoy a meal at the restaurant.

 This program focus is to process all the reservation data. Guests can add, delete, edit or view their reservations using the program. All the data are kept in a text file in resources/reservation.txt. The reservation data kept are _name, date, time, number of pax, phone number and email._

 There's a few reservation conditions:
 - Reservations must be made at least 5 days in advance.
 - Only a maximum of 4 pax can be accommodated for a single reservation.
 - The restaurant only serves 4 sessions each day:
   - 12:00 pm ‚Äì 02:00 pm
   -  02:00 pm ‚Äì 04:00 pm
   -  06:00 pm ‚Äì 08:00 pm
   -  08:00 pm ‚Äì 10:00 pm
 - Each session can only accommodate 8 reservations.

 There's also an extra function in the program to generate random dish recommendations if the guests are looking for an adventure and request to be surprised.
